## Buckle Up for An Enticing Tale...

</div>

I was born in Vancouver, and I moved to Calgary when I was 3. My parents are immigrants from small villages in Kerala, arguably (in a biased manner) one of the best states in India. This is "God's Own Country," or "the Land of Coconuts." 

My earliest memories are not from Canada, but rather, they are from India. My family goes back every 2-3 years, back when fireflies would flood the early evening sky like glowing stars we could hold, trap in our small palms. 

Have you seen a [firefly](firefly_information.md)?

Although we come from a village, the houses are big now, constructed of concrete and red roofs, built against the heat, humidity, and harsh rain. The soil is red, rich with iron, and your sandals sink in during the Monsoon season.

<p style="margin-left: 10px;">There is a red path that winds its way to our home, flanked by tall coconut trees that sway, shielding us from the fierce midday sun. But it is at night when the world awakens, and I can no longer resist stepping away from the cool, black tiles of our porch; the safe cradle of our home. Out there, the fireflies appear. They hover and dart like tiny lanterns, teasing my small, eager hands to follow. As we move along the path, they rise beneath the canopies, hiding away from the judgement of the celestial bodies that begin to shine. Umbrellas of bright green light engulf our village, umbrellas of living glow that pulse with quiet joy. Oh, the joy of being a child under their watch. I thank the fireflies, or as we call them, mina miningu, for my childhood, for my memories, and for keeping me safe.</p>

*I hope to see you again.*

*Thank you*
