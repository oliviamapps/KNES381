## Buckle Up for An Enticing Tale...

</div>

I was born in Vancouver, and I moved to Calgary when I was 3. My parents are immigrants from small villages in Kerala, arguably (in a biased manner) one of the best states in India. This is "God's Own Country," or "the Land of Coconuts." 

My earliest memories are not from Canada, but rather, they are from India. My family goes back every 2-3 years, back when fireflies would flood the early evening sky like glowing stars we could hold, trap in our small palms. 

Have you seen a [firefly](firefly_information.md)?

Although we come from a village, the houses are big now, constructed of concrete and red roofs, built against the heat, humidity, and harsh rain. The soil is red, rich with iron, and your sandals sink in during the Monsoon season.

### Glowing Umbrellas of Green

There is a red path that winds its way to our home, flanked by tall coconut trees that sway like gentle sentinels, their fronds brushing the sky and shielding us from the fierce midday sun. But at night when the world truly awakens, I can no longer resist stepping away from the cool, black tiles of our porch—the safe cradle of our home. Out there, in the hush of twilight, the fireflies appear. They hover and dart like tiny lanterns, teasing my small, eager hands to follow. As we move along the path, they rise beneath the coconut canopies, a shimmering guard against the unknown, guiding me safely as the first stars pierce the deep velvet sky. The village becomes a canopy of bright green light, umbrellas of living glow that pulse with quiet joy. Oh, the joy of being a child under their watch, wandering a world at once vast and intimate. For all my memories, for every heartbeat of wonder, I thank the fireflies—our mina miningu—for their light, their guardianship, and the magic they wove into the very fabric of my childhood.
