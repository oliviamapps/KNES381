## Buckle Up for An Enticing Tale...

</div>

I was born in Vancouver, and I moved to Calgary when I was 3. My parents are immigrants from small villages in Kerala, arguably (in a biased manner) one of the best states in India. This is "God's Own Country," or "the Land of Coconuts." 

My earliest memories are not from Canada, but rather, they are from India. My family goes back every 2-3 years, back when fireflies would flood the early evening sky like glowing stars we could hold, trap in our small palms. 

Have you seen a [firefly](firefly_information.md)?

Although we come from a village, the houses are big now, constructed of concrete and red roofs, built against the heat, humidity, and harsh rain. The soil is red, rich with iron, and your sandals sink in during the Monsoon season.

There is a red path that leads to our home, lined with tall, swinging coconut trees shielding our heads from the scorching sun. But at night, that is when I love to leave the safe embrace of the cool, black tile of our porch. The fireflies would lead me out, trailing ahead of my small-child hands. As we reached the path, they protected me from leaving the premise by rising up, underneath the coconut trees, hiding away as the real celestial bodies began to shine. Umbrellas of bright green light would engulf our village, and what joy it gave me as a child. 

I thank the fireflies, or as we call them, mina miningu, for my childhood, for my memories, and for keeping me safe.
