## Buckle Up for An Enticing Tale...

I was born in Vancouver, and I moved to Calgary when I was 3. My parents are immigrants from small villages in Kerala, arguably (in a biased manner) one of the best states in India. This is "God's Own Country," or "the Land of Coconuts." 

My earliest memories are not from Canada, but rather, they are from India. My family goes back every 2-3 years, back when fireflies would flood the early evening sky like glowing stars we could hold, trap in our small palms. 

Have you seen a firefly?
