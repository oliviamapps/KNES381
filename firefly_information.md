### So, you're curious about fireflies...

Fireflies are actually beetles (agh)! They have organs under their abdomen that take O<sub>2</sub> in. They also have cells that combine the O<sub>2</sub> with luciferin to make light, with minimal heat production. Bioluminescence is a beautiful thing, and its a phenomena I want to witness myself in the ocean. I have a folder (here)[Images_for_Markdown_Assignment] with a .png file of (highly edited) bioluminescence!

In recent years, fewer of them have been spotted. I've noticed this too, and it instills a sense of grief in me. For fireflies, light pollution may interfere with their attempts to signal to each other sing their light. It's also hard to track them because of their small size, so we don't know what their numbers are! 

So if you ever see one in the wild, treasure it, and tell your family about the wonderful experience.
